# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview
The AirBnB Clone Project is a comprehensive backend application that simulates the core functionalities of a real-world booking platform like Airbnb. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in backend development, database design, API security, and CI/CD practices. The main goal is to build a scalable, secure, and maintainable backend system that supports property listings, bookings, user management, and payments.

**Tech Stack:** Django, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Docker, GitHub Actions

---

## Team Roles
- **Backend Developer:** Designs and implements the server-side logic, APIs, and business rules using Django and GraphQL.
- **Database Administrator:** Manages the database schema, optimizes queries, ensures data integrity, and handles migrations in PostgreSQL.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages Docker containers, and automates deployment using tools like GitHub Actions.
- **QA Engineer:** Develops and executes test plans, ensures code quality, and verifies that all features work as intended.
- **Project Manager:** Coordinates the team, manages timelines, and ensures that project goals are met.

## Technology Stack
- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used to build robust RESTful APIs and manage backend logic.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful open-source relational database system for storing and managing application data.
- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that enables flexible and efficient data retrieval.
- **Docker:** Containerization platform to package the application and its dependencies for consistent deployment.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automation tool for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) workflows.

## Database Design
- **Users:**
  - Fields: id, username, email, password, date_joined
  - Relationship: Can own multiple properties, make bookings, and leave reviews.
- **Properties:**
  - Fields: id, owner_id, title, description, location, price_per_night
  - Relationship: Belongs to a user (owner), can have multiple bookings and reviews.
- **Bookings:**
  - Fields: id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status
  - Relationship: Belongs to a user and a property.
- **Reviews:**
  - Fields: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment, created_at
  - Relationship: Belongs to a user and a property.
- **Payments:**
  - Fields: id, booking_id, amount, payment_date, status
  - Relationship: Linked to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown
- **User Management:** Handles user registration, authentication, profile updates, and account security. Ensures only authorized users can access certain features.
- **Property Management:** Allows users to list, update, and remove properties. Owners can manage their property details and availability.
- **Booking System:** Enables users to search for properties, make bookings, and view their booking history. Ensures booking conflicts are avoided.
- **Review System:** Lets users leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed at, helping maintain quality and trust in the platform.
- **Payment Processing:** Manages secure payment transactions for bookings, tracks payment status, and ensures financial data integrity.

---

## API Security
- **Authentication:** Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints, typically using JWT or session-based authentication.
- **Authorization:** Restricts access to resources based on user roles and permissions (e.g., only property owners can edit their listings).
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame.
- **Data Validation & Encryption:** Protects user data by validating inputs and encrypting sensitive information.

Security is crucial to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure safe financial transactions.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying the application. This ensures that new changes are integrated smoothly and deployed reliably.

**Tools:**
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows.
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
